<p> The shop was started back in the 1960s, the same decade where afros, bell-bottoms, and things like the Lava Lamp were the hip new trends! The shop was recently purchased by a local of Northern Grand Rapids, Pawn Shop Mike. It has always been a dream of Mikes to bring 5 star customer service and satisfaction to the people of Grand Rapids in the Trade and Pawn industry. </p>
<p> If you're looking for a particlular item or just wanted to talk and browse our wares, stop on by, we'd love to have you!</p>
